----------------------------------------------- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH EXECUTIONS -----------------------------------------------
The differences between both executions is that when we execute the command cucumber, all the steps are executed,
in the other hand, execute cucumber --dry-run makes to skip all the steps, it is useful when we want to know
if we've applied Gherkin correctly, it is also useful if we want to know if some step is not implemented yet.
