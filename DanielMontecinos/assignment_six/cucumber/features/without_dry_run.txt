  Background: This step is a common one for both scenarios. # features/register_new_user.feature:8
    Given the register form for a new user is open          # features/step_definitions/my_steps.rb:1
      Inside given

  Scenario: Write a valid username                                           # features/register_new_user.feature:11
    When I fill the field username with "my_username"                        # features/step_definitions/my_steps.rb:5
      User name is my_username
    And I focus to another field                                             # features/step_definitions/my_steps.rb:9
      Inside "And"
    Then I expect the "username" field appears surrounded by a "green" color # features/step_definitions/my_steps.rb:13
      Field is username
